Verbs:
	get <url list> [options]
		- URL list is, you guessed it, a list of URLs, separated by spaces, but not inside quotes
		- Uses the same options as `tc get`
		- Output filename will be used for each file, with a number prepended to the name for each downloaded file
		- Options apply for all links. Use `tc execute` to use different options per link
	execute <filename>
		- Runs 'tc get' commands from a file, separated by lines
		- Syntax is the same as command-line tcobalt, just without `tc get` each line

Text piped in through `command | tc bulk` will be used as the space-separated url list
