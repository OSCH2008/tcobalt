This is just a wrapper around "cobalt.tools" made by wukko. I am not affiliated with wukko in any way.

Methods:
	get <url> [options]
	list

[get]
tcobalt "get" method syntax
Easy downloading for videos/songs with simple syntax
Usage: tcb get <url> [options]

Options:
	-c --vcodec <codec>        The codec of the output video. Codecs: h264, av1, vp9, Default: h264
                                   h264 and av1 are for .mp4 files, vp9 is for .webm files.

                                   The "best" option takes the format of the original audio, and may not be specified on the website you took the media from.
	-a --audio-only            Tells cobalt to only download and output the audio of the link
	-m --mute-audio             Tells cobalt to mute the audio from the downloaded content

	-o --output <filename>     The output filename. Defaults to the current datetime in the current directory. Make sure to include the proper file extension.

Add a - as the last argument if you want text piped in through `command | tcb get` to be used as the url

[list]
tcobalt "list" method syntax
All this method does is print all supported services and exits
Usage: tcb list

[bulk]
tcobalt "bulk" method syntax
Downloads multiple videos/audios at once
Usage: tcb bulk <verb> <required args> [optional args]

Verbs:
	get <url list> [options]
		- URL list is, you guessed it, a list of URLs, separated by spaces, but not inside quotes
		- Uses the same options as `tcb get`
		- Output filename will be used for each file, with a number prepended to the name for each downloaded file
		- Options apply for all links. Use `tcb execute` to use different options per link
	execute <filename>
		- Runs 'tcb get' commands from a file, separated by lines
		- Syntax is the same as command-line tcobalt, just without `tcb get` each line

Text piped in through `command | tcb bulk` will be used as the space-separated url list, but dont support GET options
